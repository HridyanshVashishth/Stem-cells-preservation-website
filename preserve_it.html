        <p><strong>Select Your Bank</strong><br>
        <ul class="star-bullet">
            <li><em>Public Bank:</em> Donated for public use, free of charge, and may help anyone in need.</li>
            <li><em>Private Bank:</em> Stored exclusively for your familyâ€™s use, with fees for collection and annual storage.</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p><strong>Sign Up in Advance</strong><br>
        Contact your chosen bank before the delivery date. Enrollment involves simple paperwork and a storage plan, if choosing a private bank.</p>

        <p><strong>Collection at Birth</strong><br>
        After the birth, the umbilical cord is clamped and safely cut. Medical staff collect cord blood using a sterile kit â€” a quick, safe, and painless process for mom and baby!</p>

        <p><strong>Safe Transportation</strong><br>
        The collected cord blood is carefully packaged and sent to the cord blood bankâ€™s facility. Handled with care, it reaches the bank quickly for immediate processing.</p>

        <p><strong>Processing and Cryogenic Storage</strong><br>
        At the lab, specialists process the blood to concentrate valuable stem cells. The stem cells are then cryogenically preserved, ready for potential future use.</p>

        <h3>ðŸ’¡ Why Preserve Cord Blood?</h3>
        <ul class="star-bullet">
            <li><strong>Future Health Options:</strong> Stem cells can treat over 80 diseases today, like leukemia, anemia, and immune disorders. New research is exploring treatments for diabetes, heart disease, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Compatibility & Adaptability:</strong> Stem cells from cord blood adapt well and are less likely to be rejected, making them a powerful option for family members.</li>
            <li><strong>Exclusive Family Access:</strong> Private banks store your childâ€™s stem cells exclusively for your family, providing access to treatments if ever needed.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Whether you choose a public or private cord blood bank, preserving the umbilical cord today can be a priceless gift for your familyâ€™s future health. Cord blood banking is a remarkable step in modern preservation, unlocking the unique power of stem cells at a time when it matters most!</p>

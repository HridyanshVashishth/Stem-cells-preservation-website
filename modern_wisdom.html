                <h2>1. Cord Blood Banking: Securing the Future</h2>
                <p>
                    Cord blood banking is one of the most common modern methods of preserving the umbilical cord. After birth, the blood from the umbilical cord is collected and stored in specialized facilities, known as cord blood banks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Stem Cell Preservation:</strong> Cord blood is rich in hematopoietic stem cells, which have the ability to regenerate and repair damaged tissues. These cells are used to treat over 80 diseases, including leukemia, lymphoma, and certain genetic disorders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Private vs. Public Banking:</strong> Families can choose between private banking, where the cord blood is stored for personal use, or public banking, where it can be donated to help others in need of stem cell transplants.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h2>2. Tissue Banking: Preserving the Umbilical Cord for Regenerative Therapies</h2>
                <p>
                    In addition to cord blood, the tissue from the umbilical cord itself contains a valuable source of mesenchymal stem cells. These cells are key players in regenerative medicine, capable of transforming into bone, cartilage, and other tissue types.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Medical Applications:</strong> Mesenchymal stem cells are being studied for use in treating conditions such as heart disease, arthritis, and neurological disorders. Storing umbilical cord tissue ensures access to these cells for future medical breakthroughs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Process:</strong> After the birth, the umbilical cord is collected, processed, and cryopreserved (frozen) for long-term storage, ensuring the cells remain viable for decades.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-box">
                <h2>3. Cryopreservation: Long-Term Storage for Future Use</h2>
                <p>
                    Cryopreservation is the cutting-edge technology behind both cord blood and tissue banking. It involves freezing the cells at extremely low temperatures (-196Â°C) to halt their biological activity, preserving them for future medical treatments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Advantages:</strong> Cryopreservation ensures that the stem cells remain in perfect condition for many years, ready to be used whenever they are needed, either by the child or even potentially by siblings or family members.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Future Potential:</strong> As medical research advances, the preserved stem cells may offer treatment options for diseases that are currently untreatable, making it a valuable resource for the future.

                <h2>4. Delayed Cord Clamping: An Immediate Health Boost</h2>
                <p>
                    Though not a preservation method, delayed cord clamping is a modern practice that allows more blood to flow from the placenta to the baby after birth. By waiting for about 1-3 minutes before clamping the umbilical cord, the newborn can receive an increased supply of oxygen-rich blood and stem cells.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Benefits:</strong> This simple practice is known to improve iron levels in infants and may support better development in the early months of life.
                </p>

            <p class="body-text">
                Modern methods of preserving the umbilical cord are transforming the way we approach healthcare. By banking cord blood or tissue, families are making an investment in their future, ensuring that they have access to cutting-edge medical treatments for generations to come.
